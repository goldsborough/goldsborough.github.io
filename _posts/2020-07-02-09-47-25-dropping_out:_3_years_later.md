10 Brock Street, London. July 3rd, 2017. I'm in the Facebook London office, in
the last few weeks of my internship. It's a beautiful sunny day outside and the
sky is blue. No, wait, that doesn't sound right. This is London. Correction:
It's a gloomy day and raining outside. I have a meeting with my skip manager,
who I meet with every few weeks. The conversation goes something like this:

__Manager__: Peter, the team likes your work and you've impressed some people.<br>
__Peter__: Nice.<br>
__Manager__: So, what are your plans for after your internship?<br>
__Peter__: Well, I should probably go back to university in Munich and finish my Computer Science degree. After, I'm not sure.<br>
__Manager__: Ok, well, listen: If you *so happened* not to want to go back to university, it is, *in theory*, possible for me to change your return internship offer into a full time offer instead. The team could really use your help.

After plugging this through the Enigma machine and decyphering it, this amounted
to an offer to join Facebook full time if I wanted to drop out of college. It
was an offer -- an opportunity -- not a request or a demand. It was my choice.
So how did I decide?

## The Story

Let me give you some more background on how we got to this moment in time. I was
19, going on 20. I had started a degree in Computer Science at the Technical
University of Munich two years prior, in the fall of 2015, after leaving the
pristine lakes of southern Austria where I grew up. In that same fall of 2015,
two months into university, I interviewed for a software engineering internship
at Google and bagged it. I did a solid two semesters at TU Munich following
that, which I did enjoy, although I spent most of my time in a little room
studying and working on research projects. My internship at Google in London
followed. I had to take a semester off for this, as the German academic year
(October to August) aligns badly with the summer internship schedule run by
American tech companies. Because I was already taking a whole semester off and
had some time left after Google, I accepted an offer for another internship from
Bloomberg, also in London. At the end of my internship at Bloomberg I started
interviewing for internships for the next summer (2017) and got an offer from
Facebook. Facebook's schedule was not a lot better than Google's, so I pleaded
my university advisor to give me another semester off. "Just one more, that's
it." Famous last words. In between Bloomberg and Facebook I joined a small
startup doing machine learning research and engaged in an unforgettable
month-long hackathon. Finally, there we were: July 2017, fourth consecutive
internship, two semesters down at TU Munich. I really *was* planning to go back to
Munich after Facebook, until that fateful conversation I recollected above.

I had to think about this decision of course. I needed to meditate on it and
gather data and opinions from the people I was close with and whose opinion I
respected. In hindsight, there is one crucial aspect about *the way* in which I
approached this decision: I treated both options, returning to college after
Facebook or dropping out to join Facebook, as equally viable, "untainted" paths
that could each lead to success in their own way. I believe that is not what most
people would do. Most people would consider returning to college the safe path,
the accepted path, the path their parents and society approves of, the one that
will lead to great knowledge and ability, the path that results in a
distinguished A4 document laid into ones hands by the gatekeepers of societal
and professional recognition. In the US you even get a hat. The idea of dropping
out to join a company, on the other hand, would undoubtedly leave a certain
taint of unease in most people's minds. It would appear rebellious, unsafe,
short-sighted, taking away your own opportunity and sort of lobotomizing your
future self. Good luck trying to make an objective decision with this kind of
baggage attached to one side of the scale.

I really didn't care much for this baggage. I wanted to evaluate these two
options analytically, on their face value. So I talked to people. I talked to my
colleagues at Facebook, who were in their careers where I wanted to be one
hopeful day. Almost every one of them told me to go for it, told me they wished
they had done it themselves a few years ago but simply didn't have the
opportunity or were too scared. One guy said he wouldn't generally recommend it
to every student, but in my case he thought it was a solid decision. One
teammate disagreed. He didn't like the idea and he didn't like the fact that
Facebook was even offering me this option. However, he did organize a video call
with an engineer at Facebook he knew who had never been in college at all, to
hear it from the horse's mouth. I remember that video call. The engineer told me
that in the end, he got to where he wanted to be. He said it wasn't always easy
and that he sometimes had to fight for people's recognition to proove he wasn't
a dumbfuck because he didn't have a degree. He said that sometimes engineers
around him would talk about some obscure theoretical aspect of computer science
that every student would have come across and he wouldn't get the joke. However,
the biggest thing he lacked was the sense of community shared by alumni of the
same school. While two Stanford alumni placed on opposite ends of the Amazon
*will* find each other and create the Stanford Alumni Association of the Amazon
rainforest, he didn't belong to any such tribe at all.

A brief digression. As I've talked to more people about this over the years,
I've gotten the sense that for many, college isn't really about learning things
anyway. My impression is that the biggest value people take away from college is
in the people they meet and the experiences they have. College is a place where
like-minded, like-aged individuals build a network that often carries long into
the later years of their lives. A lot of people meet their spouse in college.
And they have fun. Especially in the US and the UK, colleges are exciting
institutions with sports, societies, clubs, parties and so on. It is this that a
lot of people, in hindsight, would not give up if they had the choice I had.

My one year in college was very different. For one, German universities don't
really do societies or sports at the scale that American colleges do. There was
only one major club at TU Munich, the TU Investment Club a student hedge fund,
which I joined and which indeed provided valuable friends and contacts up until
today. But it stopped there and, at least in my environment there was no
partying, not really any fun. I spent 95% of my time in my room in the sleepy
suburb of Garching, studying and studying. Now contrast this with my year in
London. I was living some sort of fairytale life. I lived smack in the center of
one of the most vibrant cities in the world, working at hot tech companies with
quirky multicolored offices, lying upside down on couches feeding myself free
food. I was getting paid a lot of money to do work that I loved and gained
insane amounts of knowledge every day by working the job I was studying to
attain. I was having a good time with other interns, did fun activities with my
team and was sipping champagne on a ferris wheel at the Facebook summer party.
So while most people would be hard-pressed to trade in the happy-jolly-fun times
at college with the hardships and stress of their working lives any sooner than
absolutely necessary, it was quite the reverse in my case.

Back to making my decision. I, like many people, too, have parents. Like many
people's parents, mine were also not immediately thrilled by the idea of me
throwing my college degree out the window and selling my soul to the corporate
world. There were arguments. This is natural, because again, most people would
not approach the two paths as equally viable. The stigma of not having a college
degree sits too deep within the soul of our society. So the initial reaction was
"no, definitely you are not doing that". Fortunately, after some time and some
verbal fencing, we got down to the good stuff, the cold calculations, the
listing of pros and cons. Some important questions were asked and answered.
Ultimately, we came to the conclusion that in terms of *useful* knowledge to be
gained, job prospects and most importantly happiness, dropping out was the
better choice. There were repercussions of course. There would be certain doors
that would close. I wouldn't be able to apply for certain visas in certain
countries for example. However I'm a US, French and Austrian citizen and that
covers a reasonably wide job market, so missing out on working in Japan is
something I could live with as long as I was still allowed to eat Japanese food.

One thought: Dropping out might seem to many as the "riskier" option compared to
staying in university. The latter is the safe choice, where you can't really go
wrong. You'll learn something and you'll get a degree --- no risk in that. But I
didn't see it that way. I perceived both options as risky. To me, staying in
university carried a very high potential opportunity cost. There was a
legitimate risk that I would spend another two years learning less and making
less progress towards my long term goals of success than if I did drop out. As
an ambitious person who was very eager to maximize my potential in every
possible way and really had't a minute to spare in that pursuit, that outcome
seemed worse to me than discovering minor roadblocks later on due to not having
a degree.

So the decision was made. I told my manager that I wanted a full time offer. A
few weeks later I got it and accepted an offer for a full time Software
Engineering position at Facebook in Menlo Park, USA. Yes, I was moving to the US
too. In fact I was moving there for a short time anyway because after my
Facebook internship ended in August, I conveniently booked myself another
3-month internship at the Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard in Cambridge, MA to
do some machine learning research. And thus was my brief college career. Two
years, one actually there and the other on leave doing five internships.

## Life As a Dropout

Thus far I have recounted the story of how I became a college dropout. While I
was confident in my decision at the time, I certainly had my doubts and fears. I
was fearful of how my future colleagues would perceive me and doubtful of
whether I'd come to regret my decision for unforeseen reasons. When I reflect on
the past three years, there is a very noticeable "arc" in how I dealt with this
fear and doubt. In the beginning, when I first joined Facebook, I tried as hard
as possible to hide the fact that I had dropped out. The first time I recall
this fear of what people would think of me was one month before I started
full time. I was sitting at dinner with Mark Zuckerberg, in his house in Palo
Alto. A few Facebook interns every year get to partake in this "ceremony" and I
was one of them that year. I remember that throughout that evening I was asking
myself what he would think if I told him that I'd dropped out of school to join
his company. Dropping out clearly worked out pretty well for him, but I just
couldn't get myself to mention it to him. I was afraid.

At Facebook, I didn't help myself by not just joining any random part of
Facebook as my first team, but joining Facebook AI Research, where I was
surrounded by PhDs and part-time professors and, by nature of being a research
environment, ties to academia were very strong. This made the burden of my
decision, in my mind, a little bit heavier.

Fortunately, the people there really didn't seem to care about my background at
all, in a good way. I would come to find that at Facebook in general, folks
really care about your skills and the results you bring to the table. When
people ask you where you studied, they ask it as a matter of small talk and not
as a means to "vet your qualifications". You do that by getting shit done and
that's something I was pretty good at. Facebook is also known to have a high
hiring bar, so in hindsight, by virtue of me being there alone I was already
sufficiently qualified. But at the time, that still didn't make me more
comfortable at the idea of people knowing *the truth*.

Of course, I assume some of my colleagues asked themselves why a kid who wasn't
allowed to drink at team dinners was working full time at Facebook. But nobody
was ever condescending to me and I was treated as an equal in all respects at
all times based on my qualities rather than my qualifications. This was very
empowering and paired with fairly rapid progression up the career ladder, helped
to slowly etch away my doubts.

After a year or so of internal and external validation and the realization that
my fear of professional peers thinking less of me was largely unfounded, I
slowly became more open about my educational background. I tried less hard to
hide it and didn't really mind select trustees knowing about it. This process
was accelerated signficantly when I joined a new team in January 2018. This team
was led by my old skip manager, the one who had offered me to drop out in the
first place. He obviously knew all about how I had ended up here and clearly
didn't think it was a bad thing, because in one of our first big team meetings,
he let all thirty people in the team know that "Peter had dropped out to join
Facebook!" That blew my cover a lot faster than I had planned to give it up, but
maybe that was for the better. Because in the end, I recognize now that I really
worried way too much about this all that time before.

The fact of the matter is that my colleagues still didn't really care about it.
If anything, they found it cool and were impressed that I had managed to get to
where I was at my age and without a degree. There were others in our team who
came from non-traditional backgrounds, having studied something completely
different like chemical engineering or theology. They still worked their way
into the industry and it didn't matter as long as they were capable engineers.
So I realized it didn't matter that I dropped out as long as I was a capable
engineer.

Today, I'm a very open book about my decision. I'll happily let anybody know who
wants to know and when I do, I admittedly say it with a hint of pride in my
voice, even wearing it like a badge of honor. Or maybe not pride, but
confidence. Confidence that I'm not a fraud and that I made a bold decision at
the time of which I now feel confirmed. I'm no longer doubtful of my decision
and I'm no longer fearful of what people think of me if they learn of it. In
fact, if I were to meet somebody who looks down on me solely based on the fact
that I do not have the A4 laminated certification of societal recognization, I'd
know that that person is not worth my time. In the same vain, when it comes to
job prospects, if an employer were to reject me for a position I'm well suited
to, based solely on my not having a degree and not based on my experience,
skills and interview performance, I'm now in a position to politely tell that
employer to fuck off -- in more diplomatic wording. I have no interest in
working in an organization that is so obviously ineffiecient to value
qualifications over qualities and I've worked hard enough to put myself into a
position where I don't need to either.

## Hindsight

I believe so far I've made pretty clear that I do not regret my decision to drop
out. By all criteria that I could ever have come up with, it's been a complete
success. I want to close on my personal story by debriefing on why it was a bet
that paid off for me.

### Learning

Software Engineering -- not Computer Science -- is really a practical field.
There's a long list of topics to know about and some theories to have heard of,
but after that what differentiates the master software engineer from the
apprentice is not 10,000 hours more of theories, but 10,000 hours more of
building software in the real world. As such, I'm willing to bet a lot of money
that no CS degree on this planet would have taught me as much relevant knowledge
and as many relevant skills than I obtained by working in the trenches at
Facebook.

In addition, if there's one thing I believe is really lacking in our education
system today, it is the notion of mentorship. Any great craftsman in history
became a master craftsman by starting as an apprentice of another master
craftsman. Because it's how the real world works, the notion of mentorship --
more experienced engineers teaching juniors the ropes -- is deeply engrained in
any good engineering culture in industry. The reason my learning shot through
the roof when I joined Facebook is not just because it became my day-to-day job,
but because I was surrounded by engineers who had five, ten, sometimes twenty
years more experience than me and who were there to help me and teach me.
Mentorship is literally in the job description for senior engineers, it's
expected of them, and I benefited immensely from it.

I have not heard of any university program that comes even close to the level of
mentorship I received. In college you're mostly surrounded by kids who are just
as clueless and have just as much life experience as you, i.e. zero. Professors
usually don't care about you and rather than graduate students mentoring
undergrads, they usually look down at them in contempt or just pretend they
don't exist. *Zero* knowledge across generations.

Note that the knowledge I gained pertains not just to my work. I was surrounded
by "full blown" adults with families, mortgages and a multitude of personal
experiences. I not only grew professionally, but also matured immensely as a
person simply by being around adults rather than kids my age. Downside is that I
also have a mortgage now :(

### Happiness

If I were to describe myself during my college years with one word, it would be
"intense". I was intensely driven towards achieving my goals and often neglected
everything else in my life: relationships, physical health and mental health. I
never gave myself a moment to breathe or take a break. In addition, I already
mentioned that I found my life in Munich boring and that I was not particularly
"happy".

Comparing that to my life as a full time employee, I would say the biggest thing
that changed is that a huge amount of pressure fell off my shoulders when I
joined Facebook. I was working my dream job and working on my dream team in AI
research. I had realized the short-term future I had envisioned for myself.

Additionally, being full time is a lot less stressful than being an intern. In
an internship, you have 12 weeks to impress and that is really not a long time.
It's easy to go crazy over wanting to perform well, especially since every
intern has some form of imposter syndrome in the first few weeks. Even though
Facebook is known to be a very fast-paced and intense work environment,
development and evaluation cycles are much longer for full time employees and
knowing you will still be employed for the foreseeable future instead of only a
few more weeks makes a difference. I got healthier, spent a lot more time
outdoors and overall became much happier.

### Career Advancement

If we look at my decision from the perspective of career advancement, I clearly
got a lot more out of working in industry than I would have from taking more
classes. Instead of two years of knowledge accumulation to get me to the same
end result of hopefully working at a company like Facebook, I accumulated two
years of valuable work experience *at Facebook*. While peers in my age group
are starting to wave their degrees around to apply for entry level positions, I
recently interviewed at a bunch of companies and qualified predominantly for
senior engineering roles.

Most tech companies today already put out positions requiring "X level of
education OR Y years of work experience", e.g. BSc. in Engineering OR 3 years of
work relevant experience. What's interesting about this is that realistically,
the person who spent three years in the industry solving real problems will be a
much more useful engineer than the person who spent three years learning how to
proove theorems. So a BSc. might still be worth something on paper, but that
worth goes away once you're "in".

I want to dive deeper on the notion of getting "in". Let's consider two
engineers who both got hired, one because of their BSc. and one because of their
three years in industry. If they both spend another three years at that company,
the first engineer will have a BSc. and three years of experience while the
second will have six years of job experience. Who do you think will be a more
capable engineer and thus more attractive to employers? Clearly the second. The
basic conclusion is that the value of a degree is only in getting you "in",
after that its value fades over time. Do you imagine after 20 years in industry
somebody will still bother asking either of those engineers what degree they got
20 years ago?

### Finances

So far I have not touched on the subject of money. It was never a factor in my
decision making and still isn't really to this day. My college in Munich cost
€150 per semester (at the cost of other people's taxes), so when deciding
between working or staying in school, I was not making a choice between earning
or losing 100k USD/year like students in other countries might. Nevertheless, I
am clearly in a better financial situation now than I was as a student or would
be if I had stayed a student.

## Should Everybody Drop Out?

Up to this point, I've focused primarily on myself. My story, my thoughts, my
feelings. You've gathered that dropping out has worked out pretty well for me,
as far as I can tell three years on. This poses an obvious question: should
everybody drop out? Are our educational institutions completely obsolete? Would
I tell my children to skip college? Let me answer some of these questions.

### Three Factors

The first thing I want to call out is that there were three *environmental*
factors that allowed my success. The first is that my profession is in the tech
industry, the second is that I work for an American company and the third is
that it's 2020. If either of the first two factors are not given in somebody
else's situation (the latter, as of this writing, is), the odds of their success
are different. Let me explain.

For the first factor, the technology industry has been quite trailblazing in
terms of being a "high knowledge" industry that recognizes that the required
knowledge need not be attained exlusively via formal education. With "high
knowledge" I set it apart from other industries like hospitality or
construction, where vocational training is usually sufficient in place of a
theory-heavy degree. Comparing tech to other high knowledge industries like
medicine, law or civil engineering, tech industry firms are much more likely to
accept experience as a viable alternative to a college degree. In contrast, a
doctor without a medical degree, a lawyer who hasn't passed the bar exam or a
civil engineer with a high school diploma all seem unthinkable.

The second factor is that the United States is much more pragmatic than any
other country I've come across when it comes to organizational structure. I grew
up in a country where people put their titles in their passports and it's not
unthinkable to see "Dipl. Ing. Mag. Dr. Dr. Max Mustermann" on somebody's name
tag. "Ok Max, you must be important". From German colleagues I hear that even
with German tech companies I'd have a hard time applying without a master's
degree, despite a couple years at Facebook under your belt. In the end, this is
inefficient. Other companies benefit from the talent denied by firms stubbornly
insisting on academic qualifications.

Interestingly, those same countries in Europe that might not hire me today
despite my experience are countries that are revered for their *vocational
training* programs. Foreign government officials routinely visit Austria and
Germany to understand how to replicate the success of their
[vocational training model](https://www.aspeninstitute.org/blog-posts/austria-s-successful-model-vocational-education-lessons-us/).
It seems there's an unnecessary, outdated cognitive divide in these countries
between encouraging apprenticeship-based education for some sectors, but
requiring education-by-ploughing-through-books for other jobs. The US was first
to ditch the latter and
[is catching up on the former](https://www.cnn.com/2018/07/19/politics/trump-executive-order-job-training/index.html).

The last factor is time. Thirty years ago, I believe my story, swapping out
Facebook with IBM, Xeros or AT&T, would have been less likely. We could forecast
that this means other professions and other countries will follow this trend
over time, shifting their focus from academic qualifications as an indicator of
professional readiness to practical, pragmatic, skill-based recruiting. Maybe. I
hope so.

### The Purpose of Higher Education

I want to touch on the purpose of higher education. I would say the primary
purpose, as I alluded to earlier, is preparation for the job market. Getting an
undergraduate, sometimes a graduate degree, is seen by many as a right of
passage, something of a entrance exam for getting a job. It "opens up the door"
to (better) jobs. In this sense, higher education is meant to be *training* for
your future job. You learn the relevant jargon, the relevant history, the
relevant theories and the relevant techniques that your future employer expects
of you. I believe I'm not going out on a limb when saying that the prospects of
landing your dream job through this "training" is one of the motivations for
students (or their parents) to shell out up to $80,000 per year in tuition and
boarding fees.

So let's assume preparation for your dream job is the primary purpose of higher
education. Now, what if it turns out that you are ready before your graduation.
What if you happened to have prior knowledge gained via home schooling or
autodidactism, or gained the relevant skills by studying furiously on your own
outside of your regular classes, focusing on topics that are precisely relevant
to attaining your dream job. Wouldn't it be perfectly acceptable to get your
college degree as soon as an attractive employer assesses that you have the
skills they need from you? If the employer thinks I'm ready, why does the
university insist I spend another few years learning about things which, from
that point onward, are no longer required to get me a job? Because there's these
topics that every student should have heard about once in their life, even if
you never end up needing them? Well, in that case, I'm fine with everyone else
knowing about them except me. Oh, and by the way, if I don't land a job after
the valuable array of education I recieved during my college degree, where do I
ask for a refund? Why are you laughing? What do you mean "the door is right
there and I need to leave immediately"?

For my case, working as a software engineer at a big software company like
Facebook was certainly my idea of the kind of job I was hoping to get out of my
college education. Looking at it from this perspective, declining the offer to
join Facebook full time and instead returning to college would have made no
sense whatsoever. If working at a Facebook-like company was the goal of going to
school and I was attractive enough to be recruited by Facebook, my education had
served its purpose and it was perfectly acceptable to finish college early.

### Autodidactism and Unorthodox Education

I believe autodidactism, learning on your own, has a very strong case today. The
breadth of resources for self-education available on the internet is
breathtaking. Pick any topic you like and a simple Google search will pop up 10,
20, 30 high quality online courses, blog posts or books on the topic -- most of
them gratis. There is no subject taught by any university today for which you
will not find equivalent resources on the internet. If there is, somebody tell
that university nobody cares about their subject. Most importantly, you decide
what you want to learn. Nobody tells you what's important, you make the call. If
you're interested in becoming an expert on one particular topic, say
cyroptography, you can focus exclusively on that topic. If you want to go broad
and explore many different topics, all power to you. It's a sea of knowledge and
you're steering the boat.

In high school my father introduced me to Coursera and I started taking some
online courses in my leisure time. Some of them were general computer science
topics, others very specific to what I was interested at the time. The summer
before college I did a few online ourses on algorithms and data structures and
it landed me an internship at Google. During my year in university I spent
evenings doing courses on machine learning, calculus and GPU programming. Lo and
behold, I ended up working for one of the top industrial AI research labs in the
world, without having taken a calculus course in college. The things I learned
online dwarf the knowledge I retained from any of the courses I took in my year
in college.

There is one particular reason why the knowledge I obtained via online courses
was so much more valuable than what professors scribbled on blackboards in
college. The reason is that the ratio at which I was *using* the knowledge I got
from those online courses for practical applications was vastly greater than the
stuff in college. The reasoning is simple: I picked the courses because I was
interested in what I could do with the knowledge. Once I had the knowledge, I
used it and because I used it, the knowledge stuck. By contrast, in college I
was force-fed knowledge that somebody else thought I needed to know at that
point in my life. I likely didn't and thus 95% of the knowledge swiftly exited
my medium-term memory after the final exam. There's definitely been cases where
I needed to re-learn material online that had been covered by my college class
but was useless to me at the time, even though I got an A on the exam, because I
now needed it. The fact that we forget most things (I estimate 95%, with an
exponential decay) we are taught in school is widely accepted. Professors will
tell you it's important that you've at least heard the terms. I call bullshit.
If you don't remember how to do derivatives but have heard of the term
"derivative", then at the moment where you need it that is very nearly as
valuable as never having heard of it and looking up online how to do it right
then. It certainly isn't worth learning about it for 4 months if you're not
going to use it for the foreseeable future.

Now, there is one important caveat to autodidactism. You need to have very
strong, intrinsic motivation, dedication, willpower and discipline. This does
not apply to everyone. A lot of people are lazy and need somebody else to force
them to study, do homework and practice. Autodidactism is for everybody but the
lazy. You also need to have a general clue about what you *need to know*. A lot
of people start their degree without a real idea what it's about and what
they'll need to know to land a good job in that field later on. Such people
appreciate having somebody else lay out the path in front of them and tell them
what they need to know (apparently) in what order (apparently). This, again,
goes back to laziness. You can figure those things out yourself if you want to,
or you can ask other people (for free). I wasn't "priviledged" to know which
things to learn on my own, I just put in the effort to figure it out.

### A free market model for education

I want to finish my ruminations on education with a proposal for a new model of
the education system. Here I outline how, if I was given a magic wand, I would
wave said magic wand. Imagine, for this, there are no colleges as we know them
today.

Let's start with principles. We want our education system to be:
* Practically focused, emphasizing preparation for the job market;
* As affordable as possible, without raising your income tax;
* Tailored to each individual as much as possible.
None of these apply to college as we know it today.

This is what education looks like in our post-magic-wand world. College is
replaced with two forms of education: autodidactism and vocational training.

The European vocational training model is expanded to high-knowledge industries
everywhere. If your dream is to become a biologist and create novel vaccines,
your vocational biology school teaches you precisely the necessary fundamentals
to understand the domain and soon pairs you with real biologists who train you
in their profession and teach you their knowledge along the way. This can still
take five, six years. I'm not saying education becomes a 80-day bootcamp and
you're ready to cure cancer. But as opposed to doing a "biology" degree and
learning about every facet of biology for four years before you ever touch a
pipette, you learn exactly what you need to know and apply it as soon as
possible. In many cases, these vocational schools are run by the private
companies that end up hiring these students. This makes perfect sense. Companies
would want to invest in vocational training because it would churn out
fantastically well prepared students matching exactly the training these
companies need. At the same time, students would have a 100% job guarantee.
Examples of such programs are starting to pop up,
[Russian search firm Yandex's school of data analysis is a good example](https://yandexdataschool.com).

Parallel to vocational training, the alternative path to education chosen
without stigma by individuals based on their personal preference is
autodidactism. Instead of going to college campuses to be masted with
pre-packaged cookie-cutter knowledge, students stay at home and teach themselves
what they want to know to or what their dream companies list as required
knowledge. They take online courses, read books and apply for internships as
soon as possible. Once they feel ready to apply to their dream company, they do.
Companies would need to put in more effort with their interview process, since
they can no longer rely on the name of the place somebody went to school as
signal of their ability. There's many ways screening procedures could be put in
place for this and many are already in use today anyway.

Now, if there are no universities in our post-magic-wand world, who is left to
teach the online courses that are meant to obsolete these universities in the
first place? I say it's the same people who teach them today. First of all, it's
important to call out that many valuable online courses today are already taught
by employees at private companies. These employees get paid for their regular
jobs, but on top of that create educaitonal content that is relevant to the
fields in which those company operate. This goes back to the idea of private
vocational schools, which are win-win for employers as well as students who
become future hires. Secondly, researchers, i.e. the PhD students and professors
who teach college courses today, can continue to do so. Instead of college,
these reseachers work in research institutes. They do research full-time, but on
top of that share knowledge with the world for the purpose of education. They'll
no longer get paid through tuition fees, because there are no institutions to
pay tuition for. However, they can still charge for their courses. Educators can
name their own price for their courses and these courses thus become products
like all others in the free market. 

This has its own benefit. Free markets self-regulate the quality of their
products. If a product provides low value, demand for that product is low and
its producer will go out of business. Students become consumers and there is no
single more empowered entity in a free market than the consumer. Why? Because in
a free market, consumers have choice. In our world, students have choice. If you
don't like the course taught by one educator and there is an alternative course
taught by another, you can put your purchasing power into that second educator.
Compare this to college today. If you don't like the course being taught by your
professor, tough look. You're still paying 80k a year. When I buy a water boiler
on amazon and I don't like the water boiler, I return the water boiler, get a
refund and buy a different water boiler. When I pay 80k/year and the professor
teaching my course is crap, how do i get the refund for my course and take the
course from a different professor? I want more of the first, less of the second.

### Academic Careers

I've so far made the case that the traditional path of going to college and
getting an undergraduate degree in order to enter the job market is outdated and
replaceable with autodidactism and practical experience. This (hopefully now)
makes sense for those who want to enter industry and become a "worker" -- of
whatever form. But what about those striving to become researchers, pursuing the
traditional "academic career"? Is traditional education superfluous for these
individuals too?

Interesingly, academic careers consist of two components: a teaching component
and a research component. I think this is flawed. If you want to become a
researcher (scientist), I don't see why you should be under any obligation to
teach. Especially since most people who don't want to teach are horrible
teachers anyway. At the same time, I don't see why great educators need to also
be involved in research. If you're teaching calculus to undergrads, you can be
just good at that, you don't also have to do calculus research on the side. I
say this because I believe those who pursue academia to teach, shouldn't have to
get a PhD and become full professors. Educators need only to be really good at
teaching their subjects and nothing more (besides being generally interested in
the field, occasionally showing students what's beyond the basic material).
That's why a lot more people have amazing high school teachers than amazing
professors in college. Great high school teachers are great educators, not
necessarily great researchers. Professors may be great researchers, but sub-par
educators. Yet they have to do it anyway, to the students' demise.

Now for those pursuing academia because they want to do research and uncover
novel discoveries and methods in their field, getting a PhD and postdoc makes a
lot more sense. Why? Because these degree programs involve *doing research*,
which is the job these students are aiming to get after their degree *anyway*.
The only difference between doing a PhD and doing research in industry or
academia after is that during the PhD students pay to do research, while after
they get paid to do research. There is a really important point hidden here. If
somebody's goal is to become a full-time scientist, then doing a PhD is actually
not just "getting a degree", it's an *apprenticeship* in becoming a scientist! A
PhD program is a vocational school for researchers. 

In this sense, I fully support the idea of getting a PhD when your goal is to
become a researcher. However, I also think it is not the only way. In the
previous section, I explain my idea that vocational schooling and autodidactism
are both equally viable paths to enter your profession of choice. As such, I
think that getting a PhD *shouldn't be necessary* to become a researcher. But
can one become a legitimate researcher without getting a PhD? First of all,
history holds numerous examples of self-taught scientists without PhDs: Nikola
Tesla, Thomas Edison and even Henry Ford, who was an inventor (i.e. a researcher
who applies his research) first and industrialist only second. If Nikola Tesla
were to apply for a research scientist position at General Electric today, his
CV would probably be thrown in the trash in favor of PhD graduates from
Princeton. As long as that's the case, we have a problem.

I have many friends in PhD programs and as far as I can tell, the large sums of
money they're often paying are for three things: time to pursue research, an
occasionally competent academic advisor and the prestige of the institution they
are paying that money to. Prestige doesn't make anyone a rocket scientist, so we
can dismiss that as a factor of "true value" provided by a PhD program. Time is
fundamentally free, you shouldn't have to pay for it. This leaves as the sole
value of the PhD program the bi-weekly (or so) meeting with a PhD supervisor who
guides the student in the right direction and is there to bounce around ideas.
Mentors and masters (in the apprenticeship sense) are no doubt important, but
should you have to pay $50k per year for one? Sounds to me like a lot of people
are getting ripped off here, big time. Tesla, Edison and Ford certainly didn't
pay that money to whoever taught them the ropes.

The bottom line is that even though PhD programs are legitimate in the sense
that they are vocational schools, I still think they are inefficient and could
be overhauled systematically in a way that produces more value to students and
the other people funding the academic system, i.e. you, me, your neighbors and
all the other tax payers in this country. Given that academia is at the heart of the inefficient, outdated system that this whole article is arguing against, this is hardly a surprise.

getting a degree is the job of a researcher already, just they pay instead of
getting paid however, i would argue that even for research, degrees are not
necessary. Tesla, Edison, Ford etc. first pay to learn how to do research, then
get paid to do it well. This is apprenticeship researchers could do just as well
without the degrees.

### Here's to the crazy ones

The fundamental reason I dropped out of college was that I have a bias for
action, for doing rather than talking. If there is anything slowing down my
ability to produce tangible results, then that is an inefficiency that I want to
eliminate. Our modern education system, while beneficial to many people in many
ways, is so very far from a maximally efficient system that would produce the
greatest possible value to students and the society these students subsequently
enter. The biggest crime committed by this current system is that it keeps
people from becoming doers as soon as possible and denies the same recognition
to those who do as to those who spent four years learning how to do. The world
really needs more people who do, not people who talk about doing. Titles and
prestige don't build rockets to mars. Theory doesn't build self driving cars.
Only the application of theory, the actual doing, does.

So "Here's to the crazy ones. The misfits. The rebels. The troublemakers. The
round pegs in the square holes. The ones who see things differently. They're not
fond of rules. And they have no respect for the status quo. You can quote them,
disagree with them, glorify or vilify them. About the only thing you can't do is
ignore them. Because they change things. They push the human race forward. And
while some may see them as the crazy ones, we see genius. Because the people who
are crazy enough to think they can change the world, are the ones who do."
